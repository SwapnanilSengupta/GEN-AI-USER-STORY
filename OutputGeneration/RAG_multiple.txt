User Story: generate testcases for the below userstory in proper pointwise format mentioning the testcases number, tetscases steps, testcases output

As a technician, when I have completed a visit and I have chosen the email checkbox from the UI pop-up, I want the POS to be promptly delivered to the email address entered so that I can ensure the customer receives their service receipt.


Context
This issue pertains to the functionality of sending service receipts via email after a technician completes a visit. The feature is currently incomplete and requires quality assurance testing.

The email checkbox must be selectable in the UI pop-up.

The service receipt should be sent to the email address entered by the technician.

The delivery of the receipt must be prompt after the checkbox is selected.

Tech can add up to 3 emails

If tech has click on Print + Email both features should process.  

If tech clicks print and not email then only print option 

If tech doesn't select option then do not send anything to customer.
