User Story: generate testcases for the below userstory in proper pointwise format mentioning the testcases number, tetscases steps, testcases output

As a technician, when I have completed a visit and I have chosen the email checkbox from the UI pop-up, I want the POS to be promptly delivered to the email address entered so that I can ensure the customer receives their service receipt.


Context
This issue pertains to the functionality of sending service receipts via email after a technician completes a visit. The feature is currently incomplete and requires quality assurance testing.

The email checkbox must be selectable in the UI pop-up.

The service receipt should be sent to the email address entered by the technician.

The delivery of the receipt must be prompt after the checkbox is selected.

Tech can add up to 3 emails

If tech has click on Print + Email both features should process.  

If tech clicks print and not email then only print option 

If tech doesn't select option then do not send anything to customer.
Test Cases: Here are the test cases for the given user story, structured in a pointwise format.

**General Pre-requisites for all Test Cases:**
*   Technician is successfully logged into the STH App.
*   A visit has been successfully completed, and the technician is at the "Visit Completion" or "Service Proof Generation" screen where the UI pop-up appears.
*   Internet connectivity is available (unless testing offline scenarios).
*   The email sending service is operational.

**TC-SR-007: Validate handling of an invalidly formatted email address.**

*   **Test Case Number:** TC-SR-007
*   **Test Case Steps:**
    1.  Complete a service visit.
    2.  When the UI pop-up for service receipt options appears, select the "Email" checkbox.
    3.  In the email input field, enter an invalidly formatted email address (e.g., `invalid-email`, `user@.com`, `user@com`).
    4.  Click the "Send" or "Confirm" button.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   The system should display an immediate validation error message indicating an invalid email format (e.g., "Please enter a valid email address").
    *   The email should *not* be sent.
    *   The system should prevent the technician from proceeding until a valid format is entered or the email option is deselected.

**TC-SR-008: Validate handling of a validly formatted but non-existent email address (referencing TC_59).**

*   **Test Case Number:** TC-SR-008 (Linked to TC_59: Verify the CCM ticket)

    5.  Verify the success message/confirmation on the UI (initial send might appear successful).
    6.  As per TC_59, log in to iCABS and navigate to the Contact Centre Review screen after a reasonable delay for email processing and bounceback.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   The app initially shows a success message for sending the email (as the format is valid).
    *   No email is received at `nonexistent@example.com`.
    *   A CCM (Contact Centre Management) ticket is *generated in iCABS* specifically for the failed email delivery, providing details about the bounced email. This confirms the system's error handling for non-delivery.

    4.  Click the "Send" button.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   The system should either:
        *   Prevent entry of more than 3 emails (e.g., input field character limit or real-time validation).
        *   Display an error message indicating that only up to 3 emails are allowed.
        *   If it proceeds, it should only send to the first 3 emails and potentially log a warning, or fail the send entirely if strict validation is in place. (The former two are preferred from a UX perspective).
